### Chart A
### Introduction
Dear reader,

For this project, I am interested in comparing Marlon Hoffstadt his music with trance music from the 90â€™s. Marlon Hoffstadt, also know als DJ Daddy Trance, is a German DJ who combines the genres techno, house, trance and Eurodance. Personally, I am a huga fan of Marlon Hoffstadt his music. It is very creative and I really like the fact that he gets his inspiration from 90s trance music. I am wondering what features, think about dancealbility, tempo and key for example have changed since the 90s.
